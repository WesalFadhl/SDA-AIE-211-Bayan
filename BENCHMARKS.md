### Lab 4 — Arabic Model Bake-off

### Dataset
- Arabic records: 7200
- Gulf: 4800
- MSA: 2400
- Grouped test size: 1097
  - Gulf: 756
  - MSA: 341

### Results

| Model | All Macro-F1 | Gulf Macro-F1 | MSA Macro-F1 | Accuracy |
| CAMeLBERT-mix | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| CAMeLBERT-DA | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |

### Observation
Both CAMeLBERT-mix and CAMeLBERT-DA achieved identical performance on the supplied Bayan dataset. No Gulf-slice improvement was observed for CAMeLBERT-DA because CAMeLBERT-mix had already reached 100% macro-F1, producing a ceiling effect.

### Lab 5 — Bilingual Semantic Search
A FAISS semantic-search index was built over 20,000 historical cases using
L2-normalised sentence embeddings and inner-product search.

#### Retrieval Results
| Metric | Result |
| Recall@10 before reranking | 0.0308 |
| MRR@10 before reranking | 0.0104 |
| Recall@10 after reranking | 0.0231 |
| MRR@10 after reranking | 0.0073 |
| Arabic Recall@10 | 0.0167 |
| English Recall@10 | 0.0286 |
| Cross-lingual Recall gap | 0.0119 |
| Arabic MRR@10 | 0.0042 |
| English MRR@10 | 0.0100 |
| Cross-lingual MRR gap | 0.0058 |
| Bi-encoder latency | 68.51 ms/query |
| Reranked latency | 2621.91 ms/query |
| No-answer correctness | 20/20 |
| Selected no-answer threshold | -5.0 |

#### Target Check

- Recall@10 >= 0.80: Not achieved
- MRR@10 >= 0.70: Not achieved
- No-answer >= 17/20: Achieved

#### Diagnosis

The FAISS index and query vectors were both L2-normalised before
inner-product search. This is required so that inner-product ranking
behaves consistently with cosine similarity.

Without correct L2 normalisation, vector magnitude can dominate the
similarity score and produce plausible-looking results while labelled
Recall@10 and MRR@10 collapse.

After correcting and verifying normalisation, the retrieval pipeline
executed successfully, but the labelled retrieval targets were still
not achieved. The corpus contains many highly similar synthetic cases,
while evaluation depends on specific labelled case IDs. The dense
retriever often returned semantically similar cases that were not among
the labelled relevant IDs.

Cross-encoder reranking did not improve retrieval because relevant
cases that were absent from the candidate set could not be recovered
during reranking.

No-answer behaviour met the target with 20/20 correct cases.

## Lab 6 — Evaluation

### Aggregate Evaluation

| Metric | Result |
| Validation Accuracy | 0.8750 |
| Accuracy 95% CI | [0.8617, 0.8888] |
| Validation Macro-F1 | 0.8333 |
| Macro-F1 95% CI | [0.8289, 0.8375] |
| Evaluation utility tests | 6 passed |

### Model Evaluation

| Model | Aggregate Macro-F1 [95% CI] | Invariance pass | MFT pass |
| Topic classifier | 0.8333 [0.8289, 0.8375] | Not measured | Not measured |

Behavioural test utilities for invariance, directional behaviour, and
minimum-functionality testing were implemented and validated by the supplied
Lab 6 unit tests. Final behavioural pass rates were not recorded because the
final model was not executed against a labelled behavioural fixture.

### Error Taxonomy — Manual Review of 120 Errors

| Error Category | Count |
|---|---:|
| Label ambiguity | 94 |
| Preprocessing or serving skew | 15 |
| Arabic orthographic variation | 11 |
| Dialect or code-switching | 0 |
| Entity boundary or clitic alignment | 0 |
| Long-context truncation | 0 |
| Retrieval relevance mismatch | 0 |
| Annotation defect | 0 |
| **Total** | **120** |

The dominant validation failure was confusion between the `parks` and `roads`
classes.

### Top 3 Prioritised Fixes

1. Improve `parks` vs `roads` discrimination using hard training examples
   containing overlapping vocabulary.
2. Strengthen preprocessing consistency between training and inference.
3. Improve Arabic orthographic normalisation for spelling variation and
   elongated forms.

Predicted metric improvements from these fixes are hypotheses and must be
verified through a new evaluation run rather than reported as measured gains.

### HTTP serving

- Concurrency: 16

- Requests: 7064
- Errors: 0
- p50: 132.24 ms
- p90: 152.66 ms
- p95: 171.28 ms
- p99: 181.66 ms
- Throughput: 117.51 requests/sec
- HTTP p99 <= 40 ms: FAIL
- Zero-error requirement: PASS
- Startup canaries: PASS
- Serving contract: 2 passed
- Note: The HTTP latency target was not met under 16 concurrent requests. Bare ONNX INT8 inference met its latency target, indicating that serving/concurrency overhead remains an optimisation opportunity.
